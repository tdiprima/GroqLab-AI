I need you to help me turn this into a team of AI agents.

Right now, it is just one API completion from Groq, running the new llama 3.2 model.

However, I want a team of 3 different agents, each of which will be a function wrapping the API call.

It will be a Programming team of agents, with 3 unique agents - you propose which roles are most suited for this team.

Keep it simple, and make sure each agent gets the output from the previous one using simple variables 

And the last agent outputs it as a python file.

The goal of this team of agents is to help me develop any app or script, even if I have no programming skills whatsoever.

So make sure to add enough debugging print statements so the user knows what's happening.

Keep the code clean and easy to understand, with explanatory comments.
